This project aims to develop an AI-powered system capable of recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures. Using machine learning algorithms, the system can interpret hand movements captured through video or image inputs and convert them into corresponding text or speech. It contains:
collect images file
create dataset file
display images
interence classifier
load images
rotate images
train classifier
